#### **Shield Lib** is a library that makes it easy to add custom shields with banner support, enchantments, custom shapes, & custom effects across **Fabric** & **Neoforge** without conflicts!

#### We also provide event hooks & modifier registries for shields and shield enchantments for creating custom effects with them by modifying blocking, disabling, movement, or cooldown.

### Enchanting:
